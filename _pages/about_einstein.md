Hi, I'm Jui-Chao (Jerry). I recently graduated from [National Taiwan Univiersity](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), where I received my Bachelor's degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) with a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) in June 2025. Currently, I am a research assistant at [NTU Computational Learning Lab](https://learner.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) advised by [Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/). Previously, I was also fortunated to be mentored by [Professor Hung-Yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) under [NTU Speech Lab](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php).

I am interested in diffusion models, alignment problem and multimodal learning. My goal is to develop solutions to steer agents to generate precise and preferred response. My previous research includes test-time alignment on diffusion models, agent system optimization and collaborative filtering.
